Implementation of a cluster with OpenNebula and JBoss: Fault Tollerance and Migration.


This repository contains the report on the "Middleware Systems" university project. For practical reasons the scripts are included in the report


The document shows how to configure a virtual cluster, through the use of a computer and the OpenNebula, Jboss and KVM softwares, in order to implement the migration and fault tolerance features that allow to maintain the status of a web application even if one or more of the web servers that make up the cluster crashes or is shut down.
